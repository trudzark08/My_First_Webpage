    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Carl and I am a gamer.</p>
    <p>I have been the goto tech guy for my family since I was a teen and build my own PC's, I am interested in game development and most things computer related. I recently completed a cyber security course with Code Nation and I am awaiting the results.</p>
    <p>I am also an artist and prop maker, I studied art and design in college. I have made various props to go with costumes I wore to Comicon like swords and masks.</p>
    <p>Lastly I love cooking, and subsequently eating, various foods.</p>
